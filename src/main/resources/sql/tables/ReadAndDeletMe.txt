This is the place to put all the queries related to table creation and deletion.
(for example: a table that has been specifically created for the application's usage)
These queries are not launched automatically during application startup and therefore the tables need to be created and/or updated manually.
The reason behind this choice is that we don't want to lose the information within the tables each time we launch the application.
